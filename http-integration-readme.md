To integrate the IPVSADM HTTP API into an agent app to get proxy information, you will need to:

Choose a programming language and framework. There are many different programming languages and frameworks that you can use to integrate an API into your app. Some popular choices include Python, Java, and Node.js.
Install the necessary libraries. Once you have chosen a programming language and framework, you will need to install the necessary libraries to make HTTP requests and parse the API responses.
Make an HTTP request to the IPVSADM HTTP API to get proxy information. The IPVSADM HTTP API is a REST API that provides access to IPVS configuration data. To get proxy information, you can send an HTTP GET request to the /proxy endpoint.
Parse the API response to extract the proxy information. The IPVSADM HTTP API returns JSON responses. You can use a JSON parser to parse the response and extract the proxy information that you need.
Integrate the proxy information into your agent app. Once you have parsed the API response, you can integrate the proxy information into your agent app however you need. For example, you could display the proxy information in a user interface, store it in a database, or use it to perform some other task.
Here is a simple example of how to integrate the IPVSADM HTTP API into a Python agent app to get proxy information:

Python
import requests

# Set the IPVSADM HTTP API URL
IPVSADM_HTTP_API_URL = 'http://localhost:8080/proxy'

# Make an HTTP GET request to the IPVSADM HTTP API to get proxy information
response = requests.get(IPVSADM_HTTP_API_URL)

# Parse the API response to extract the proxy information
proxies = response.json()['proxies']

# Iterate over the list of proxies and print their names
for proxy in proxies:
    print(proxy['name'])

This example shows how to make a simple HTTP GET request to the IPVSADM HTTP API to get a list of proxies. The response is then parsed to extract the list of proxies, which is then iterated over and printed to the console.

You can use this example as a starting point to integrate the IPVSADM HTTP API into your own agent app to get proxy information. The specific steps involved will vary depending on the programming language and framework that you are using.

Here are some additional tips for integrating the IPVSADM HTTP API into your agent app to get proxy information:

Use a library to make HTTP requests. There are many different libraries available that can make HTTP requests easier. Using a library can help to simplify your code and make it more robust.
Use a library to parse the API responses. There are also many different libraries available that can parse JSON responses from APIs. Using a library can help to simplify your code and make it more efficient.
Handle errors gracefully. It is important to handle errors gracefully when integrating with an API. For example, you should check the HTTP status code of the response to ensure that it was successful. If the response was not successful, you should handle the error appropriately.
Document your code. It is important to document your code so that other developers can understand how it works. This is especially important when integrating with an API, as you will need to document the API endpoints that you are using and the parameters that you are passing to them.
By following these tips, you can integrate the IPVSADM HTTP API into your agent app to get proxy information in a reliable and efficient way.
